Performance Monitoring: Regularly reviewing how your investments are performing against established benchmarks and providing performance reports.

Buying/Selling: Executing trades (buying and selling securities) on your behalf, especially for clients with discretionary accounts.

  <h1>Debt Management and Liability Planning</h1>
  <p1>While investment professionals primarily focus on growing your assets, they also play a crucial role in managing your liabilities (debt).

Debt Prioritization Strategy: Analyzing all your outstanding debt (mortgages, student loans, credit cards) and recommending the most efficient strategy for repayment, often prioritizing high-interest debt first.

Refinancing Analysis: Advising on whether it makes financial sense to refinance a mortgage, student loan, or other major debt, and how a lower payment or interest rate fits into the overall financial plan.

Coordination with Estate Attorneys: Working closely with your attorney to ensure your assets (like investment accounts) are titled correctly and that beneficiary designations align perfectly with your will and trust documents.</p1>
